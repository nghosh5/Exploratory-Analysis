# Exploratory-Analysis on FBI US Police Staffing data for past 9 years ( 2007- 2015 )
Facing growing concerns about policing in the US, you are hired to analyze data on police staffing data. 
You are provided with data from the FBI on police staffing by city, for the past full 9 years (2007-2015).
1. Load and examine the data files. 
2. For each file, ensure that the data are “clean” and “tidy” and represent relevant data years. 
3. Combine the data files into a single file using the rbind() function. 
4. Examine the relationship between population and total law enforcement employees. 
5. Examine the trends in staffing in cities over 2 million. Because population varies over the years, 
   use an average population in the time periods to determine relevant cities 
6. How does police staffing in Chicago compare to trends found in other large cities?
